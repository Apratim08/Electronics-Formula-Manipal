## Project Overview

Formula Manipal is a student project based out of Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy of Higher Education that designs and fabricates Formula Style race cars and competes in Formula Student Competitions. <br /><br />
During the season <b>2019-2020</b>, The Electronics team developed a unique data acquisition, logging, live telemetry, and display system developed using the Controller Area Network (CAN) communication protocol as the backbone of the arrangement. 
The main controller of the CAN system was the myRIO which was programmed using LabVIEW. The data acquisition/logging system, although did not directly
affect the carâ€™s performance, but was indispensable when it came to the testing and design phase of the car. Designers would validate their assumptions and calculations, real-time data during testing could be a safety indicator and 
it provides insight to the driver about the performance of the vehicle. The FPGA-based controller for CAN was designed for data acquisition and live telemetry system with the interest of the formula car team in mind. 
The design choices were made to improve and deliver a more effective system than the pre-existing ones. All choices of controllers, sensors, formatting were custom made for the requirements of the team. 
All programmable devices were coded individually to suit the system and the graphical user interface was designed internally. Data acquired by the proposed system helps in making sure that the car achieves the goals that were envisioned when it was designed.
